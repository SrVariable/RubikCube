### Uppercase

- **B**: Rotate the B face 90Âº counterclockwise.
- **F**: Rotate the F face 90Âº clockwise.
- **L**: Rotate the L face 90Âº counterclockwise.
- **R**: Rotate the R face 90Âº clockwise.
- **U**: Rotate the U face 90Âº clockwise.
- **D**: Rotate the D face 90Âº counterclockwise
- **M**: Rotate the middle layer parallel to the R and L faces 90Âº counterclockwise.
- **E**: Rotate the middle layer parallel to the U and D faces 90Âº counterclockwise.
- **S**: Rotate the middle layer parallel to the F and B faces 90Âº clockwise.

### Lowercase

- **b**: Rotate the B face and the middle layer parallel to the F and B faces 90Âº counterclockwise.
- **f**: Rotate the F face and the middle layer parallel to the F and B faces 90Âº clockwise.
- **l**: Rotate the L face and middle layer parallel to the R and L faces 90Âº counterclockwise.
- **r**: Rotate the R face and middle layer parallel to the R and L faces 90Âº clockwise.
- **u**: Rotate the U face and middle layer parallel to the U and D faces face 90Âº clockwise.
- **d**: Rotate the D face and middle layer parallel to the U and D faces face 90Âº counterclockwise
- **x**: Rotate the cube in the X axis 90Âº clockwise.
- **y**: Rotate the cube in the Y axis 90Âº clockwise.
- **z**: Rotate the cube in the Z axis 90Âº clockwise.

> [!NOTE]
> Adding 2 after the letter will make the same movement twice. So B2 is the same as doing B B.
> 
> Adding \' after the letter will make the reverse movement. So B' is the same as doing B B B.

## How to Play

When you run the program it will display the original position of the cube and will ask you to introduce a movement (listed before). You can introduce more than one movement in a single turn. For example:

> **Introduce a movement: B2FL'R**

This will do B2, F, L', R.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you introduce more than one movement in a single turn, it will directly display the cube with the respective movements applied.

> [!TIP]
> 
> To undo a movement you have to type the opposite movement in reverse.
>
> So in order to undo B2FL'R you will have to type R'LF'B'B'.
